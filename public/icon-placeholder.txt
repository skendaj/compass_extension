Icon Placeholder Instructions
===========================

This extension needs icon files for Chrome. You can:

1. Use an icon generator (like https://www.iconarchive.com/ or Figma)
2. Create icons at these sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
3. Save them as PNG files
4. Place them in the /icons directory with these names:
   - icon16.png
   - icon48.png
   - icon128.png

Recommended Icon Design:
- Theme: Knowledge/Light bulb/Brain/Search
- Colors: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) to match UI
- Style: Modern, flat design
- Background: Transparent

For now, you can use placeholder icons or copy from the dist folder after build.

Temporary Workaround:
- The extension will work without icons
- Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon
- Add proper icons before production deployment
